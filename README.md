PROJECT NOTES

Overview :

This project demonstrates Spring Framework dependency injection and object management using Java classes representing a simple school scenario. The core entities are Student, Pen, Pencil, Teacher, and the interface Writer.


Class Explanations :

1.Writer (interface)

* Contracts a writing() method, implemented by writing tools (Pen, Pencil).

2.Pen (implements Writer)

* Properties: color (String), price (int).

* Implements writing() to print a message.

* Getters/setters for properties.

3.Pencil (implements Writer)

* Implements writing() to print a unique message indicating pencil use.

4.Teacher

* Uses Lombok's @Data for boilerplate code.Properties: employeeid, Name, department.

* (Note: Field Name should conventionally be lowercase: name.)

5.Student (extends Pen)

* Core properties: name, age, pen (type: Pen), writer (type: Writer).

* Multiple constructors for flexibility (with or without Pen/Writer).

* show() method prints the student's name and age, and calls writing() for both writer and pen.


Spring Integration : 

Beans are configured in XML, allowing for property and constructor-based injection.

Both Pen and Pencil are recognized by Spring as beans, and injected as dependencies where needed.

Student can be wired with different writers and pens, highlighting dependency injection benefits.


Best Practices Observed :

Interface-driven design: Writer ensures a consistent contract for writing tools.

Use of Lombok: Reduces boilerplate in Teacher class.

Separation of concerns: Each class models a single real-world subject or role.Potential Improvements
Use consistent field naming (example: Name â†’ name in Teacher).

Handle possible NullPointerException in Student.show() if writer or pen are not set.

Consider making Student not extend Pen (prefer composition over inheritance, i.e., "has-a" rather than "is-a" relationship).
